Amazon Copilot Demo - Conversation Summary (as of October 5, 2025)

1. Initial Debugging:
- Checked for compile and lint errors in main test and page files; no errors found.
- Ran Maven tests; discovered a failure in AmazonTest.testSearchProduct due to unreliable search result verification.

2. Test Improvement:
- Identified that HomePage.verifyResultsDisplayed was checking the page title for 'results', which is unreliable.
- Updated verifyResultsDisplayed to check for actual product result elements using a CSS selector.
- Reran tests; the issue was resolved and tests passed.

3. Multiple Product Search:
- User requested to search for both 'iPhone 15' and a TV product in a single browsing session.
- Updated AmazonTest.java to search for both products sequentially and verify results for each.
- Ensured the search box is cleared before each search to avoid concatenated queries.
- Reran tests; both searches worked as expected in one session.

4. Test Structure Clarification:
- Explained that each @Test method runs in its own browser session due to test lifecycle management.
- Removed the single-product test as per user request, leaving only the multiple product search test.
- Confirmed that only the multiple product search test runs, and it passes.

5. Final State:
- AmazonTest.java now contains only testSearchMultipleProducts, which searches for 'iPhone 15' and 'Samsung TV' in one session.
- HomePage.java reliably verifies search results by checking for product elements.
- All tests pass and the automation is robust for sequential product searches.

6. Screenshot Capture Enhancement:
- Added screenshot functionality to the automation, so after each product search ("iPhone 15" and "Samsung TV"), a screenshot is automatically saved.
- Screenshots are named iphone15-results.png and samsungtv-results.png and stored in the project directory.
- This provides visual evidence for each search result and helps with validation and documentation.
